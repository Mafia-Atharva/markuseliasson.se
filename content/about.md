I am a 34 year old developer focused on user oriented software. Me and my
family is located in the small city Karlskrona in the south of Sweden, where
I currently I work as a consultant at [Softhouse](http://www.softhouse.se).

My current foucs is web application development where I am a full-stack
developer, that gives me opportunity to work close to the user in presentation
layer which I really enjoy - as well as craft clean, elegant and efficient
middleware code.
