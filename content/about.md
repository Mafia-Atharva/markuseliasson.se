I am Markus Eliasson - a 34 year old developer focused on user oriented software. Me and my family is located in the small city Karlskrona in the south of Sweden, where I currently I work as a consultant at [Softhouse](http://www.softhouse.se).

My current foucs is web application development where I am a full-stack developer, that gives me opportunity to work close to the user in presentation layer which I really enjoy - as well as craft clean, elegant and efficient middleware code.


## Side projects

In my assignments I tend to be involved in requirement discussions, architectural work, development, fire fighting - while all fun nothing scratch my programming itch as good as a few hobby projects!
