# Site of Markus Eliasson

This is the personal site and blog for http://www.markuseliasson.se, powered by
the static site generator [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com).


## Getting started

Probably not of great interest to anyone but me, but due to my frequency of
blogging I really need these commands written down.

    # Create a new article
    $Â hugo new article/my-new-article.md

    # Run a local server
    $ hugo server --theme=liquorice --buildDrafts --watch

    # Generate only published pages with this command
    hugo -t liquorice
